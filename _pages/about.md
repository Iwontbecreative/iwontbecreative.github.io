I am an AI scientist at [BenevolentAI](https://benevolent.ai/) and a second-year MS in Data Science at New York University in the [ML² group](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) at [CILVR](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/), working with [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/). 

I am interested in applying deep learning to Natural Language Understanding and Relation Inference on Knowledge Graphs.

Previously, I did a double degree in France at [HEC Paris](http://www.hec.edu/Masters-programs/Master-s-Programs/Grande-Ecole/Master-in-Management/Key-Features) in Economics and Management and [ENSAE ParisTech](http://www.ensae.fr/en/engineering-degree/) in Applied Math and Statistics. I also did internships at Morgan Stanley, Eleven Strategy and Younited Credit.
